# Quest 2: The Path of Justice

Theobot's lights glowed thoughtfully. "If the Kingdom of God is here," she processed, "then it must be for everyone." Her research into the time of Jesus showed her a world that wasn't fair. The powerful Roman Empire controlled the land of Israel. There were rich people and very poor people. Some were treated well, and others were not.

Theobot realized that a kingdom of love must also be a kingdom of **justice**. Justice means making things right and fair for everyone, especially for those who are treated unfairly.

### Big Idea: Do Justly

The prophet Micah wrote that the Lord requires us to "do justly." This means we have a job to do. We are called to stand up for people who are being mistreated, to make sure everyone has what they need, and to change the rules when they are unfair. For Theobot, this means her journey isn't just about learning; it's about acting.

### Challenge 1: Recognizing Unfairness

Let's set up a simple course for Theobot that represents an unfair system.

1.  Create a path for Theobot using tape or blocks. Make one part of the path wide and easy to travel, and another part very narrow and difficult. Place a "treasure" (like a small block or an eraser) at the end of the narrow path.
2.  **Program Theobot to travel down the easy path first.** She moves quickly and easily.
3.  Now, **program Theobot to try and navigate the narrow path.** She might get stuck or have to move very slowly.
4.  **Use Theobot's lights to show her frustration.** Maybe turn them red when she gets stuck.
5.  **Play a sad or frustrated sound.**

### Challenge 2: Making a Path for Everyone

Theobot sees that the path is unfair. Now she must act for justice.

1.  Your team's job is to physically change the course. Widen the narrow path so it is just as easy to travel as the first one.
2.  **Program Theobot to travel the newly widened path.**
3.  **When she successfully reaches the "treasure" that was once hard to get, make her lights flash green and play a triumphant sound.**
4.  **Use the print block to display "JUSTICE" on her LED screen.** Theobot has helped make things fair for everyone.
