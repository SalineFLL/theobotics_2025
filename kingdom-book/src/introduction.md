# Introduction to Theobotics

Welcome, young programmers and adventurers! You are about to embark on a special journey with a robot named Theobot. In this adventure, you won't just be learning to code; you'll be exploring one of the biggest and most exciting ideas ever: the Kingdom of God.

## What is Theobotics?

"Theobotics" is a word we made up! It combines "Theology" (which is the study of God) and "Robotics" (which is the study of robots). We're going to use a fun, programmable robot called a FinchBot to help us understand what it means to live in God's kingdom, right here and right now.

## Meet Theobot

Theobot is a special FinchBot on a mission. She has heard Jesus's prayer, "Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven," and she wants to find out what that really means. What does this kingdom look like? How do we live in it? And what does it mean to have a king we can't see?

## Your Mission

Your job is to program Theobot and guide her through five special quests. Each quest will help Theobot—and you!—discover a new piece of the puzzle. You'll learn about the big ideas of justice, mercy, and humility, and how they are the building blocks of God's kingdom.

We'll also travel back in time to understand the world Jesus lived in. It was a place occupied by the powerful Roman Empire, which made talking about a different kind of kingdom a brave and sometimes dangerous thing to do.

Are you ready to help Theobot on her adventure? Let's get started!
