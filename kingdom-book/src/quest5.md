# Quest 5: A Kingdom Not of This World

Theobot had learned about justice, mercy, and humility. She understood that this was the way of God's Kingdom. But one thing still confused her. She read about Jesus standing before the Roman governor, Pontius Pilate. Pilate asked Jesus if he was a king. Jesus replied, "My kingdom is not of this world."

What did he mean? Theobot's whole adventure was about bringing the kingdom to *this* world!

She finally understood. When Jesus said his kingdom was not *of* this world, he meant it didn't come from the same source of power as Rome. Rome's power came from swords, armies, and force. Jesus's kingdom comes from a different source: God's love. It operates with different values: justice, mercy, and humility.

This is why Jesus's message was so dangerous. It challenged the way the world worked. It said that the poor were blessed, that the last would be first, and that the true king served his people. This was a revolution of love, and it threatened the kingdoms that were built on power and fear.

### Big Idea: A Different Kind of Power

Our king, Jesus, rules in a way that looks very different from the kings of the world. He doesn't force us to follow him. He invites us. His power is the power of love, which is stronger than any army. When we choose to live with justice, mercy, and humility, we are showing the world what this different kind of kingdom looks like.

### Final Challenge: The Two Paths

Let's represent the two kinds of kingdoms with our FinchBot.

1.  On one side of your workspace, create a "Roman Path." Make it straight and rigid. Place a cutout of a sword or a symbol of power at the end.
2.  On the other side, create a "Kingdom Path." Make it winding and gentle. Place a cutout of a heart or a cross at the end.
3.  **First, program Theobot to travel the Roman Path.**
    * Make her move fast and aggressively.
    * Use a single, bold color for her lights, like red.
    * Make her play a marching sound.
    * When she reaches the end, have her flash her lights like an alarm.
4.  **Now, program Theobot to travel the Kingdom Path.**
    * Make her move slowly and gently.
    * Have her lights cycle through a rainbow of colors, representing all people.
    * Make her play a peaceful, musical tone.
    * When she reaches the end, have her beak light glow a soft, steady white, and have her print "LOVE" on her screen.

By completing this final challenge, Theobot—and you—have demonstrated the core difference between the kingdoms of this world and the powerful, gentle, and loving Kingdom of God. Well done, Theobotics Engineers!
