# Quest 1: The Adventure Begins

Theobot whirred to life, her lights blinking. A question echoed in her circuits, a prayer she had heard from her human friends: "Your kingdom come... on earth." What was this "kingdom"? Was it a place with castles and kings? Theobot knew about earthly kingdoms from her data banks. They had rulers, laws, and armies. But this prayer felt... different.

Her first mission was clear: she needed to understand the very basics of this new kind of kingdom.

### Big Idea: The Kingdom of God is Here and Now

The Kingdom of God isn't just a place we go to when we die. It's something we can be a part of right now. It's a way of living together that shows the world what God is like. When we are kind, when we share, when we take care of each other and the world around us, we are building the Kingdom of God.

Jesus started this kingdom, and he invited everyone to join. He is our king, but he doesn't rule with an army. He rules with love.

### Challenge 1: Theobot's Awakening

Theobot is just starting her journey. Let's program her to "wake up" to the idea of the Kingdom of God.

1.  **Program Theobot to turn on her beak light to a bright, hopeful color, like yellow or light blue.** This light represents the beginning of her understanding.
2.  **Make Theobot move forward a small amount, about 20 cm.** This is her first step into the adventure.
3.  **Have Theobot play a happy sound.** She is excited to learn!
4.  **Use the print block to display the word "KINGDOM" on her LED screen.**

### Challenge 2: Spreading the Light

The Kingdom of God is good news that we share with others. Let's program Theobot to share her new light.

1.  Place a few cups or other objects around Theobot. These represent people who haven't heard about the kingdom yet.
2.  **Program Theobot to turn towards one of the objects.**
3.  **Move Theobot towards the object until she is close to it.**
4.  **When she reaches the object, make her lights flash a few times.** She is sharing the good news!
5.  **Bonus:** Program Theobot to visit more than one "person" and share her light.
