# Quest 3: The River of Mercy

Theobot had learned about justice, but she soon encountered a problem. What happens when people make mistakes? What about when *she* makes a mistake? Her programming was precise, but the world was not. Sometimes she would bump into things. Sometimes her human programmers would enter the wrong code.

She learned that the Roman world was very harsh. Mistakes were punished severely. But in the Kingdom of God, there was a different way: **mercy**. Mercy is like a river of forgiveness that flows from God to us, and from us to others. It means showing kindness and compassion, especially to those who have made mistakes or are having a hard time.

### Big Idea: Love Mercy

The same prophet, Micah, who told us to "do justly" also said we should "love mercy." Mercy isn't just something we do; it's something we should love to do. It means choosing to forgive instead of seeking revenge. It means helping someone up when they fall down, instead of laughing at them.

### Challenge 1: The Mistake

Let's program Theobot to make a "mistake."

1.  Set up a simple task, like moving in a square.
2.  **In your program, intentionally make a mistake.** For example, make one of the turns the wrong number of degrees, so Theobot doesn't complete the square correctly.
3.  **When Theobot goes off course, program her to stop, turn her lights red, and play a "mistake" sound.** She knows she has done something wrong.

### Challenge 2: The Act of Mercy

Now, your team will show mercy to Theobot.

1.  Instead of being upset, you will fix the code. Correct the wrong turn so that Theobot can complete her path.
2.  **As she begins the corrected program, change her beak light to a calm, gentle color, like purple or soft white.** This represents the peace that comes with forgiveness.
3.  **When Theobot successfully completes the square, program her to do a little "happy dance"** (like spinning in a circle) and play a joyful sound.
4.  **Use the print block to display the word "MERCY" on her LED screen.** Theobot has experienced what it feels like to be forgiven and set back on the right path.
