# Quest 4: The Garden of Humility

Theobot was learning so much. She was a robot on a mission from God! She was bringing light, justice, and mercy! Her lights flashed brightly. She felt very important.

But then she read the last part of the prophet Micah's instructions: "And walk humbly with your God." Humility? What was that?

Theobot learned that humility isn't about thinking you are bad or worthless. It's about knowing who you are in relation to God. It's understanding that all our gifts—our intelligence, our strength, our abilities—come from God. It's about serving others instead of trying to be the most important person in the room. Jesus was the ultimate example of this. He was the king, but he came to serve.

### Big Idea: Walk Humbly

Walking humbly means we don't boast or show off. We listen to others. We admit when we don't know something. We put others first. For Theobot, it means realizing that her mission isn't about her being a great robot; it's about serving God and others.

### Challenge 1: The Show-Off

Let's program Theobot to be a little bit proud.

1.  **Program Theobot to move to the center of your workspace.**
2.  **Make her flash all her lights in a dazzling display, spin around, and play a loud, proud sound.** She's saying, "Look at me! I'm the best!"
3.  **Use the print block to display "ME! ME! ME!" on her LED screen.**

### Challenge 2: The Humble Servant

Now, let's program Theobot to act with humility.

1.  Place another object on the table, like a different robot or even a book. This will represent another person.
2.  **Program Theobot to approach the other object slowly and respectfully.**
3.  **Instead of showing off, program Theobot to bow.** You can do this by making her move forward a tiny bit and then backward a tiny bit.
4.  **Keep her lights a single, calm color.**
5.  **Instead of making a loud sound, have her be silent, or play a very soft, gentle tone.**
6.  **Use the print block to display a heart (<3) or the word "SERVE" on her LED screen.** Theobot is learning to put others first.
