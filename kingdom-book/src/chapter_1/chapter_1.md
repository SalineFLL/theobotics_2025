# Chapter 1

Theobot is just like you.
She goes to church and even has most of The Lord's Prayer memorized.
One thing about The Lord's Prayer has her a bit confused.
Part of the prayer says "Your Kingdom come, Your will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven."

Theobot has heard of the Kingdom of God before, but what is it?
Is it a place in the clouds with beautiful homes?
Is it somewhere on Earth? Maybe the Garden of Eden?

Who is in the kingdom? If there's a kingdom, there must be a king or a queen.
Who are they? What about princes and princesses? Knights with swords and horses?
Does the Kingdom of God wage wars like she always hears and reads about in stories?
