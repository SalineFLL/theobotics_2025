# Day 5: Kingdom Living

Theo reached the final quest in his journey to explore the Kingdom.
He had seen the difference between Pharaoh's kingdom of fear and Jesus' Kingdom of love.
She saw God's rescue plan when he parted the Red Sea, opening a new way for his people where there was no way before **(Exodus 14:21â€“31)**.

He finally understood. The Kingdom of God isn't a place we have to wait for.
Jesus said, **"The kingdom of God is within you" (Luke 17:21)**.
It's here and now! When we choose love, courage, and service, we are bringing a little piece of heaven to earth.
We are living out Jesus' prayer: **"On earth as it is in heaven."** We are walking on the new path God has opened for us.

### Key Question: What can we do to bring the Kingdom to earth?

### Final Challenge: The Kingdom Celebration

Today, Theo won't just act out a story; he will become a tool for building the Kingdom. Your challenge is to use Theo to do something good for others.

**Build your own mission:**

* It could represent events in scripture discussed this week.
* It could represent something you talked about with an expert (Julius, Ayesha)
* It could represent your service to others with Food Gatherers.
