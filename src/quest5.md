# Day 5: Living the Kin-dom Now (Heaven on Earth)

Theobot reached the final quest in her journey to explore the Kin-dom.
She had seen the difference between Pharaoh's kingdom of fear and Jesus' Kin-dom of love.
She saw God's rescue plan when he parted the Red Sea, opening a new way for his people where there was no way before **(Exodus 14:21–31)**.

She finally understood. The Kin-dom of God isn't a place we have to wait for.
Jesus said, **"The kingdom of God is within you" (Luke 17:21)**.
It's here and now! When we choose love, courage, and service, we are bringing a little piece of heaven to earth.
We are living out Jesus's prayer: **"On earth as it is in heaven."** We are walking on the new path God has opened for us.

### Key Question: What can we do to bring the Kin-dom to earth?

### Final Challenge: The Kin-dom Celebration

Today, Theobot won't just act out a story; she will become a tool for building the Kin-dom. Your challenge is to use Theobot to do something good for others.

**Choose one of these two missions:**

**Mission A: Theobot the Encourager**
1.  Think of someone in your group or class who you want to encourage.
2.  **Program Theobot to deliver a message of kindness.**
3.  **Record a message** using the sound recorder, like "You are a great friend!" or "God loves you!"
4.  **Program Theobot to travel to that person.**
5.  **When she arrives, have her play the encouraging message, flash her lights in beautiful colors, and display a smiley face `:)` on her LED screen.**

**Mission B: Theobot the Gatherer**
1.  If you are doing a service project, like making lunches for the hungry or collecting items for a charity, Theobot can help!
2.  **Create a "collection zone" on your table.**
3.  **Program Theobot to help gather items.** You can attach a small paper scoop to her front.
4.  **Program her to go out, collect a small item (like a piece of paper representing a prayer or a bottle cap representing a donation), and bring it back to the collection zone.**
5.  **Each time she successfully delivers an item, have her play a positive sound and flash green.**

By completing this final challenge, you and Theobot are not just learning about the Kin-dom—you are building it. You are bringing heaven to earth, one act of love at a time.
