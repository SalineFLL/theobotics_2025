# Introduction: The King and the Kin-dom

Welcome, Theobotics Engineers! Our robot, Theo, is ready for the first set of quests. We're going to dig deep into the part of The Lord's prayer Jesus taught us: **"Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven."**

When Jesus prayed this, it was a dangerous prayer. He lived in a world ruled by powerful kings and emperors who built kingdoms based on fear and control. The most famous example from the Old Testament was Pharaoh, a king who enslaved God's people to build his own empire.

Jesus' idea of a kingdom was completely different. It was so different that we're going to use a special word for it: **Kin-dom**.

The word **Kin-dom** reminds us that God's kingdom is like a big, loving family. It’s not about power and pyramids with a king at the top; it's about relationships, community, and taking care of our "kin"—our brothers and sisters. It’s a kingdom built on love, not fear.

In these five quests, you will program Theo to explore the difference between a worldly kingdom, like Pharaoh's, and God's heavenly **Kin-dom**. Theobot will learn what it means to choose freedom over fear, courage over comfort, and service over power, all so we can help build God's Kin-dom right here, right now.
