# Day 3: God’s Rescue Plan (Deliverance vs. Domination)

Theo saw how the Israelites were trapped in Pharaoh's kingdom of domination.
They couldn't escape on their own.
But God had a rescue plan.
He called out from a burning bush to a man named Moses and said, **"I have come down to rescue [my people] from the hand of the Egyptians" (Exodus 3:8)**.

God's will is not for people to be trapped and dominated.
God's will is for deliverance and freedom.
Jesus leads us out of the things that trap us.
As Jesus said, **"If the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed" (John 8:36)**.

### Key Question: What does real freedom look like in God’s Kingdom?

---

### Challenge: The Great Escape

Let's program Theo to act out God's rescue plan.

1.  Create a "maze" or an obstacle course for Theo. This represents the things that trap us (fear, sadness, unfair rules). Place Theo at the start.
2.  **First, program Theo to try and get through the maze on his own.** He should bump into walls and get stuck. Make his lights flash red and play a frustrated sound when he gets too close to walls. He is trapped.
3.  **Now, it's time for God's rescue plan!** Your team will act as God's delivering hand. Create a clear path through the maze.
    * The path through the maze should be a thick black line with very sharp boundaries. If the maze has gradual curves instead of sharp corners, we should be able to teach the kids proportional feedback for line following here.
4.  **Program Theo to travel down the newly opened path.** He should move smoothly and without stopping.
5.  **As he travels the path to freedom, make his lights a hopeful green.**
6.  **When he exits the maze, have him do a victory spin and play a triumphant sound.**
7.  **Use the print block to display "RESCUED" on his LED screen.** Theo has been set free by God's rescue plan.
