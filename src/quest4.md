# Day 4: Navigating the Mazes of Life

Theo was learning that the leader of God's Kingdom was very different from Pharaoh.
Pharaoh sat on a throne and gave orders. He shouted, **"Who is the LORD, that I should obey him...?" (Exodus 5:2)**.
He was a tyrant who cared only about his own power.

Then Theo read about Jesus. On the night before he died, Jesus, the true king, did something shocking.
He knelt down and washed his disciples' feet, a job for the lowest servant **(John 13:12–17)**.
He taught them, **"Whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant" (Matthew 20:26)**.

Theo's circuits buzzed. In God's Kingdom, a true leader isn't a boss; a true leader is a servant.

### Key Question: What kind of leaders do we follow—and what kind will we be?

---

Start by finishing yesterday's maze. Build several traps of oppression along the way, and a beacon of hope representing God's kingdom (maybe a burning bush) at the exit.

### Challenge 1: Follow a bad leader

1. Hardcode the robot's path through the maze
    * This is easier to program than a dynamic method relying on proportional feedback
    * The problem is, our path is always changing, so we need to learn discernment to know we're doing Kingdom living

### Challenge 2: Follow God

1. Figure out how to get yesterday's proportional feedback code to get Theo through the maze
