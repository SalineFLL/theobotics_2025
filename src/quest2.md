# Day 2: Courage in the Kingdom (Loyalty to Pharaoh or God?)

Yesterday Theo learned about the difference between kingdoms built on power and fear, and God's kingdom of peace and love.

Theo continued his studies. In Pharaoh's kingdom, everyone had to obey the king's commands, even when they were cruel and wrong.
But Theo discovered a story about two brave women, the midwives Shiphrah and Puah **(Exodus 1:15–21)**.
Pharaoh ordered them to do something terrible, but they refused. They chose to obey God rather than a human king.

Theo learned that living in God's Kingdom sometimes takes courage.
It means standing up for what is right, even when you are afraid. As the apostles later said, **"We must obey God rather than men" (Acts 5:29)**.

### Key Question: When is it right to say “no” to wrong?

---

### Challenge 1: Pharaoh's Command

Let's create a situation where Theo receives a wrong command.

1.  Place a "helpless" object on the table, something like a Solo cup might be a good choice, or build your own object.
2.  **Program Theo to approach the object, detect it with his ultrasonic distance sensor, and stop a specific distance from the object. Then, Theo should turn to push it off the table using a stick.** This represents Pharaoh's cruel command.
    * Make Theo's lights transition from green, to yellow, then orange, then red as he gets closer to the object, to show this is a bad action. 
    * Use the distance sensor's output to trigger the changing light colors

### Challenge 2: An Act of Courage

The midwives said "no" to Pharaoh. Now Theobot will, too.

1.  Reset the scene with the "helpless" object on the table.
2.  This time, **program Theobot to approach the object, but instead of pushing it, he must stop.** He should use his ultrasonic distance sensor to "know" when he is close.
3.  **Have Theobot shake his "head"** by turning left a little, then right a little, several times. He is saying "No."
4.  **Program Theobot to turn around and move away from the object.** He has refused the wrong command.
5.  **Change his lights to a strong, steady color, like blue or white.** This represents the peace and strength that comes from doing the right thing.
6.  **Use the print block to display "NO" on his LED screen.** Theobot has shown courage, and lived according to the Kingdom of God.
