# Day 2: Courage in the Kin-dom (Loyalty to Pharaoh or God?)

Theobot continued her studies. In Pharaoh's kingdom, everyone had to obey the king's commands, even when they were cruel and wrong. But Theobot discovered a story about two brave women, the midwives Shiphrah and Puah **(Exodus 1:15–21)**. Pharaoh ordered them to do something terrible, but they refused. They chose to obey God rather than a human king.

Theobot learned that living in God's Kin-dom sometimes takes courage. It means standing up for what is right, even when you are afraid. As the apostles later said, **"We must obey God rather than men" (Acts 5:29)**.

### Key Question: When is it right to say “no” to wrong?

---

### Challenge 1: Pharaoh's Command

Let's create a situation where Theobot receives a wrong command.

1.  Place a smaller, "helpless" object on the table (like an eraser or a cotton ball).
2.  **Program Theobot to approach the object and push it off the table.** This represents Pharaoh's cruel command. Make her lights red to show this is a bad action.

### Challenge 2: An Act of Courage

The midwives said "no" to Pharaoh. Now Theobot will, too.

1.  Reset the scene with the "helpless" object on the table.
2.  This time, **program Theobot to approach the object, but instead of pushing it, she must stop.**
3.  **Have Theobot shake her "head"** by turning left a little, then right a little, several times. She is saying "No."
4.  **Program Theobot to turn around and move away from the object.** She has refused the wrong command.
5.  **Change her lights to a strong, steady color, like blue or white.** This represents the peace and strength that comes from doing the right thing.
6.  **Use the print block to display "NO" and then "GOD" on her LED screen.** Theobot has shown courage and loyalty to the Kin-dom of God.
