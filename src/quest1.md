# Day 1: Whose Kingdom Is This? (Power vs. Freedom)

Theo booted up. His memory banks filled with stories of ancient Egypt.
He read about Pharaoh, a mighty king who built a huge kingdom with towering pyramids.
But this kingdom was built on fear and oppression. **(Exodus 1:8–14)**.
Pharaoh forced the Hebrews to be his slaves. They weren't free.

Then, Theo processed the words of Jesus: **"The Spirit of the Lord is on me... He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners..." (Luke 4:18–19)**.
Theo realized there were two very different kinds of kingdoms. One traps you, and one sets you free.

### Key Question: What is the difference between God’s intended kin-dom and an earthly kingdom?

### Challenge 1: Theo in Pharaoh's Kingdom

Let's program Theo to act like he is a slave in Pharaoh's kingdom of fear.

1.  Create a small, confined space for Theo using books or blocks. This is his "prison."
2.  **Program Theo to move back and forth in a short, repetitive pattern inside the space.** He is doing forced labor.
3.  **Set Theo's lights to a dark or intimidating color, like red or a dim orange.** This represents fear and control.
4.  **Have Theo make a low, sad, or tired sound.**
5.  **Use the print block to display the word "FEAR" on his LED screen.**

### Challenge 2: Theo Enters the Kingdom

Now, let's show the freedom Jesus brings.

1.  Make a Jesus costume for Theo to dress up in.
2.  Have Theo, dressed as Jesus, smash down a wall of the "prison".
3.  **Program Theo to move out of the space where he was trapped.**
4.  **Make him move in a joyful, wandering path.** He can spin, zig-zag, and explore. Get creative! He is free!
5.  **Change his lights to bright, happy colors. Make them cycle like a rainbow!**
6.  **Have him play a cheerful, musical sound.**
7.  **Use the print block to display the word "FREE" on his LED screen.** Theo is experiencing the freedom of God's Kingdom.
