# Day 1: Whose Kingdom Is This? (Power vs. Freedom)

Theobot booted up, her memory banks filled with stories of ancient Egypt. She read about Pharaoh, a mighty king who built a huge kingdom with towering pyramids. But this kingdom was built on fear. **(Exodus 1:8–14)**. Pharaoh forced the Israelites to be his slaves. They weren't free.

Then, Theobot processed the words of Jesus: **"The Spirit of the Lord is on me... He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners..." (Luke 4:18–19)**. Theobot realized there were two very different kinds of kingdoms. One traps you, and one sets you free.

### Key Question: What is the difference between God’s intended kin-dom and an earthly kingdom?

### Challenge 1: Theobot in Pharaoh's Kingdom

Let's program Theobot to act like she is a slave in Pharaoh's kingdom of fear.

1.  Create a small, confined space for Theobot using books or blocks. This is her "prison."
2.  **Program Theobot to move back and forth in a short, repetitive pattern inside the space.** She is doing forced labor.
3.  **Set Theobot's lights to a dark or intimidating color, like red or a dim orange.** This represents fear and control.
4.  **Have Theobot make a low, sad, or tired sound.**
5.  **Use the print block to display the word "FEAR" on her LED screen.**

### Challenge 2: Theobot Enters the Kin-dom

Now, let's show the freedom Jesus brings.

1.  Your team will physically remove the walls of the "prison."
2.  **Program Theobot to move out of the space where she was trapped.**
3.  **Make her move in a joyful, wandering path.** She can spin, zig-zag, and explore. She is free!
4.  **Change her lights to bright, happy colors. Make them cycle like a rainbow!**
5.  **Have her play a cheerful, musical sound.**
6.  **Use the print block to display the word "FREE" on her LED screen.** Theobot is experiencing the freedom of God's Kin-dom.
